            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Konggidagon Onsuwanna, and I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at Khon Kaen University. 
                I’m interested in studying Artificial intelligence, and I also want to try new things I’ve never done before and live a happy life.
                <br> Currently, I’m studying web development in one of my courses. I hope we can exchange knowledge about our studies in the future.
            </p>

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the key projects I've worked on during my studies:</p>
                <blockquote><b style="font-size: 110%;">
                1. Sleep early challenge project.
                </b><br />
                    This is one of the projects I did for my English IV course, called the "Sleep Early Challenge." 
                    In this challenge, my group and I committed to going to bed early for seven days and 
                    observed any changes in our behavior or feelings after completing the challenge.

                <h3>3 years of being a student in Khon Kaen University.</h3>
                <p>July 12, 2025</p>
                <p>Since I started studying at Khon Kaen University as a student in the Faculty of Engineering, 
                    majoring in Computer Engineering, I’ve been very happy. I’ve met many friends, and everyone is friendly. 
                    <br>I’ve enjoyed both studying and traveling with my group of friends — it has been a great life during my first year.</p>
                <p>In my second year, the studies became more serious, so I didn’t get to travel as much, but I still found happiness in each day. 
                    On days when some classes ended in the evening, I enjoyed looking up at the sky — it helped me relax and feel less tired. 
                    After that, <br>I would go find something delicious to eat before heading back to my dorm.
                </p>
                <p>In my third year, not much time has passed yet, but it’s already been an incredibly busy period. 
                    I have to visit various companies related to my field of study, and when I return, 
                    I also work part-time. Even though it’s just a little experience, <br> it’s been worthwhile. 
                    I hope this will turn out to be a good year.
                </p>
